# Historical Decisions & Migrations

## Migration Index
- `20260916152548_init` — first migration, applied 2026-09-16. Creates
  all 8 models (see the same-day decision below for the full list and
  the assumptions behind the 4 reconstructed-from-context ones).
  Confirmed applied via `prisma migrate status` ("Database schema is up
  to date"). Required being off the office Wi-Fi — see
  context/subsystem-notes.md's port-blocking gotcha.

## Decisions
- **2026-09-16** | Built the gap-analysis engine (`src/lib/gap-analysis.ts`,
  TDD, 15 passing Vitest tests) covering Sections 4.1-4.5: emergency fund,
  debt EMI/prioritization, term/health cover gap, and the 4.5 KPI layer,
  composed into `computeGapAnalysis` | **why**: next item in the build
  order (Section 7, Task 4); pure/deterministic functions per the
  no-ML invariant | **resolves the two open schema questions from the
  Task 2 entry below**:
  - Effective health cover = `personalHealthCoverAmount +
    employerHealthCoverAmount` (straight sum) — no v1 source for a
    weighting rule, so the simplest defensible combination was used.
  - `ExistingDebt`'s EMI fields (`outstandingAmount`, `interestRatePct`,
    `tenureMonths`) map directly onto the plan's Section 4.5 EMI formula
    with no gaps.
  **new assumptions made, not from a v1 source**:
  - Emergency fund status thresholds: `adequate` at ≥100% of target,
    `inadequate` below 50%, `building` in between. The plan names the
    three states but never gives thresholds.
  - `recommended_health_cover` is `config.health_cover_baseline` flat,
    not scaled by `dependentsCount` — matches the config comment's literal
    wording ("baseline"), but this is a real product decision someone
    could reasonably make differently.
  - Zero-interest debts fall back to straight-line EMI (`outstanding /
    tenureMonths`) since the compound-interest formula divides by zero
    at a 0% rate — an implementation necessity, not a business-logic
    guess.
  **rejected**: guessing v1's exact thresholds instead of picking and
  documenting new ones — no source existed to guess from | **not yet
  done**: not wired to a DB read/write or an API route — `computeGapAnalysis`
  takes plain numbers in, returns plain numbers out, with no persistence
  or Prisma Decimal handling yet.
- **2026-09-16** | Wrote the full `schema.prisma` (all 8 models: `User`,
  `FinancialProfile`, `ExistingDebt`, `InsuranceProfile`,
  `AllocationResult`, `GapAnalysisResult`, `FundReference`,
  `InsurancePlanReference`), not just the two v2-NEW tables |
  **why**: implementationplanv2.md Section 2 says `users`,
  `financial_profile`, `insurance_profile`, and `allocation_results`
  "carry over unchanged from v1," but no v1 plan/schema document exists
  anywhere in this repo or its git history (`git log --all` shows only
  `implementationplanv2.md` was ever committed) — so there was no source
  of truth to copy. User chose (2026-09-16, in response to being asked)
  to have these designed from context rather than left out or supplied
  separately | **assumptions made, not sourced from a v1 doc — verify
  before treating as final**:
  - `FinancialProfile`/`InsuranceProfile` are 1 row per user (onboarding
    form, updated in place); `GapAnalysisResult`/`AllocationResult` are
    N rows per user (a `computedAt`-stamped history), since the plan's
    "computed_at" column implies recomputation over time, not a single
    snapshot.
  - `existing_debts` (Section 4.5's EMI formula) is a separate
    `ExistingDebt` table FK'd to `FinancialProfile`, with
    `outstandingAmount`/`interestRatePct`/`tenureMonths`/a free-text
    `label` — the plan never names the debt fields directly, only the
    EMI formula that consumes them.
  - `InsuranceProfile.personalHealthCoverAmount` +
    `employerHealthCoverAmount` are two separate stored fields; the
    plan's `effective_existing_cover` (Section 4.5) is treated as a
    computed value the gap-analysis engine derives from both, not a
    stored column — the combination rule (e.g. does employer cover count
    in full?) still needs to be decided when Task 4 (gap analysis
    engine) is built.
  - `recommended_term_cover` / `recommended_health_cover` (referenced in
    the Section 4.5 formulas) are treated as computed-not-stored,
    reconstructible from `termCoverGap`/`healthCoverGap` +
    `existingTermCoverAmount`/effective health cover — only the gap and
    the adequacy percentage are persisted, matching the plan's literal
    column list for `gap_analysis_results`.
  - `consentGivenAt` (nullable timestamp) added to both
    `FinancialProfile` and `InsuranceProfile` per the plan's mention of
    "v1 consent rules for `financial_profile` and `insurance_profile`"
    and Section 3's "consent tracking unchanged" — the actual consent
    *flow* (what triggers it, what text is shown) is still undefined
    pending Task 3 (onboarding UI).
  - All money amounts are `Decimal` (never `Float`), percentages are
    `Decimal(7,2)` — avoids floating-point rounding on financial figures.
  - IDs are `cuid()` strings (Prisma's zero-dependency default), not
    `uuid()` — no particular reason to prefer one for a demo project.
  **rejected**: scoping Task 2 down to only the two NEW tables (would
  leave `gap_analysis_results` unable to store its base v1 columns, and
  block Tasks 4-6 which read/write the carried-over models) | **applied**:
  migration `20260916152548_init` (see Migration Index above) — the
  assumptions above are still unverified against a real v1 source, just
  no longer blocking Task 2.
- **2026-09-09** | Chose **Supabase** as the managed Postgres provider
  (plan Section 1 previously left it open between Supabase/Neon) | **why**:
  user decision | **implementation**: two connection strings —
  `DATABASE_URL` (pooled/Supavisor, port 6543) for the app runtime via
  `src/lib/db.ts`'s adapter, `DIRECT_URL` (direct, port 5432) for
  `prisma migrate`/introspection via `prisma.config.ts`, since Supabase's
  pooler doesn't support the DDL + shadow-database work migrate needs |
  **resolved 2026-09-16**: see below.
- **2026-09-16** | Created the real Supabase project (ref
  `kyjsothfwxsbqxaaqqqt`, ap-south-1) and dropped real credentials into
  `.env`, replacing the placeholder `DATABASE_URL`/`DIRECT_URL` | **why**:
  unblocks Task 2 (DB schema + migrations), the item this was gating |
  **verified**: both the pooled (6543) and direct (5432) connection
  strings reach the database — confirmed via a raw `pg` connection and
  via `prisma migrate status`, which reports no migrations yet (expected,
  since `schema.prisma` still has zero models) | **note**: an initial
  `prisma migrate status` attempt returned P1001 (unreachable); a retry
  seconds later succeeded, consistent with the project still finishing
  cold-start provisioning — not a config problem.
- **2026-09-09** | Pinned `prisma` and `@prisma/client` to matching
  `7.10.0`, added `@prisma/adapter-pg`, moved connection config from
  `schema.prisma`'s `datasource.url` to `prisma.config.ts` | **why**:
  Prisma 7 removed `datasource.url` from the schema and requires
  driver-adapter-based `PrismaClient` construction; the project had
  drifted to a mismatched `prisma@8.0.0-rc.13` / `@prisma/client@7.10.0`,
  which broke generation | **rejected**: staying on the mismatched
  versions, or using `prisma-client-js` without an adapter (unsupported
  in v7). Commit `b787329`.
- **2026-09-09** | Disabled Next.js's auto-generated `AGENTS.md`/
  `CLAUDE.md` agent-rule files | **why**: they conflict with a
  hand-maintained second-brain `CLAUDE.md` | **rejected**: letting
  Next.js regenerate them on every `next dev`/`next build`.
- **(plan-level, predates this repo)** v2 shows real, named fund and
  insurance plan examples where v1 deliberately showed categories only |
  **why**: naming specific products is only legal here because this is an
  unpublished personal/portfolio demo, not a live service — doing so for
  a real service would require SEBI RIA registration (fund advice) and
  IRDAI web-aggregator licensing (insurance leads) | **rejected**: keeping
  v1's category-only behavior permanently. **Revisit trigger**: if the
  project ever moves toward real users beyond demo/portfolio use (the
  "closed beta with friends/family" milestone named in Section 7) — see
  implementationplanv2.md Sections 0.2 and 7.
